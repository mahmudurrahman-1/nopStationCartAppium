### Additional functionalities, that may be covered:

1. The more, the better. Only if it makes sense. Use your imagination and write some additional tests if you feel you
   can cover other important functionalities.
2. Please include any third party test reporting tools(Ex. Extent Report, Allure report) in your automation project.
